# Financial_Risk_Detection
The project aims to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
and machine learning to conduct risk analysis for loan default
prediction in the context of a consumer finance company. By
analyzing historical loan application data, we will identify patterns
and factors that indicate whether a client is likely to default on their
loan payments. This analysis will assist the company in minimizing
financial losses while ensuring that creditworthy applicants are not
unfairly rejected.
